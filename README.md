# Starbucks-customer-spend-predict-and-offer-recommendation-engine

Background

Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer.
Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. We can find in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, we can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.
We will use transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer.
With the dataset above, I will make a prediction on customer spend by using machine learning and recommendation engine with User-User Based Collaborative Filtering.
